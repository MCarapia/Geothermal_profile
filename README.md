This repository was created by Miguel Ángel Carapia Pérez in May 2023. This code uses Matlab's Partial Differential Equation Toolbox to
solve the finite difference heat equation in two dimensions.
Half of a symmetrical Earth is modeled with different layers having independent thermal properties.  
The code was created for a manuscript submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 
with the name “Atmospheric influence on lithosphere formation during cooling of a global magma ocean.”
The name of the figures is related to the order in the manuscript.

Geothermal_profile is a function made in Matlab to determine the influence that the atmosphere had on the cooling of the 
planet after the impact that gave rise to the Moon.

Manuscript_figures is a script for the creation of the figures 

The T_sol_liq function is used to obtain the melting curves.
